Caulerpa prolifera sampling transects
-------------------------------------

To determine the spatial distribution of *Caulerpa prolifera*, divers swam transects across a canal in the Ria Formosa lagoon (South Portugal) and stopped at pre-determined intervals to collect samples.

-   The track of the divers was recorded by GPS, which was on a buoy attached to divers
-   GPS track is continuous between transects, including boat travel
-   There are a total of 4 transects
-   Sampling points were also determined by having a user look at footage of the dives, mark the times at which samples were taken and them crossing them with the GPS data. These points were then used to confirm if this automatic method is accurate

**GOALS:**
1. To determine start and end point of each transect, isolate and extract them
2. Using the extracted transects, attempt to determine sampling points

### Isolating transects

Let's start by importing the tracks. File format is ".gpx". For conveniency, I will convert this information into a matrix-like format. There are 4 also tracks on record. We are only interested in the last one.

``` r
track <- readOGR("./GPS_tracks.gpx", layer = "track_points")
```

    ## OGR data source with driver: GPX 
    ## Source: "C:\Users\marci\Documents\R resources\z_Projects\Caulerpa_sampling\GPS_tracks.gpx", layer: "track_points"
    ## with 10476 features
    ## It has 26 fields

``` r
points <- tibble("trackID" = track@data$track_fid,   #Select variables we are interested in
                 "time"    = track@data$time,
                 "lat"     = track@coords[,2],
                 "long"    = track@coords[,1]) %>%
          filter(trackID == 4) %>%                   #Only keep track 4
          select(-trackID)                           #Remove trackID variable

#Time is imported as a factor, change to POSIXct date
points$time <- as.character(points$time) %>%
               ymd_hms()

head(points)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 3
    ##   time                  lat  long
    ##   <dttm>              <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 2018-01-25 12:38:15  37.0 -7.81
    ## 2 2018-01-25 12:38:16  37.0 -7.81
    ## 3 2018-01-25 12:38:17  37.0 -7.81
    ## 4 2018-01-25 12:38:18  37.0 -7.81
    ## 5 2018-01-25 12:38:19  37.0 -7.81
    ## 6 2018-01-25 12:38:20  37.0 -7.81

Now the information is in a tibble (basically a data.frame, or a matrix). This format is very easy to manipulate, as well as plot using ggplot2.

Let's start by getting a glimpse of the full track:

``` r
#Assign a number ID to the points, it will be used to identify points later
points$nr <- c(1:nrow(points))

map <- get_map(location = c(long = -7.819869, lat = 37.00763),
               color = "color",
               source = "google",
               maptype = "satellite",
               zoom = 14)
ggmap(map) +
  geom_path(data = points, aes(x = long, y = lat), size = 1) +
  lims(x = c(min(points$long), max(points$long)), y = c(37.00176, 37.01067)) +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")
```

<img src="README_files/figure-markdown_github/track_plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Using this information, we need to extract the starting and ending points of each transect. Visually, I can easily find all of the tracks. Since this is possible, I will create an interactive map to allow me to extract the ID number of these points.

> Due to limitations in github .md files, this does not work on the github page.

Using this interactive map we can approximate the first and last points of each trasect and obtain their ID:
\* Transect one: Points 1 to 581
\* Transect two: Points 2401 to 3811
\* Transect three: Points 5311 to 6601
\* Transect four : Points 8311 to 9571

We can now extract the transects.

``` r
t1 <- points %>%
      filter(nr <= 581)
t1$transect <- 1

t2 <- points %>%
      filter(nr >= 2401 & nr <= 3811)
t2$transect <- 2

t3 <- points %>%
      filter(nr >= 5311 & nr <= 6601)
t3$transect <- 3

t4 <- points %>%
      filter(nr >= 8311 & nr <= 9571)
t4$transect <- 4

transects <- rbind(t1,t2,t3,t4) %>%
             mutate(transect = as.factor(transect))

ggmap(map) +
  geom_path(data = transects, aes(x = long, y = lat, color = transect, group = transect), size = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#e41a1c", "#4daf4a", "#984ea3","#ff7f00")) +
  lims(x = c(min(points$long), max(points$long)), y = c(37.00176, 37.01067)) +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="README_files/figure-markdown_github/transects-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> The resulting transects seem accurate. However, results should be confirmed by checking starting and ending times for transects in the videos. To make this task easier, let's make a table with start/end times for the transects obtained here.

``` r
kable(transects %>%
      group_by(transect) %>%
      summarise(Start = min(time), End = max(time)),
  align = c("c","c","c"),
  format = "html") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

Sampling points
---------------

Now that we have the transects, let's see how accurate an automated methodology to determine sampling points would be. With one point per second, we have a pretty high resolution track for the transects. An interesting method might be to estimate diver's speeds along the transects to find stopping points.

To do so, we will:
\* Calculate the total distance travelled from start of transect until current point
\* Calculate travel speed at each point

We can the distance between any two points p1 and p2:
Distance <sub>p1 to p2</sub> = Square root ((X<sub>2</sub> - X<sub>1</sub>) + (Y<sub>2</sub> - Y<sub>1</sub>))

The full distance travelled from the start of the transect to any given time is then simply the cumulative sum of distances of all previous points. To this we will call Delta Distance.

We can now estimate their speed. The current speed at any given point will be calculated as the speed over the previous 10 seconds:
Speed<sub>at time</sub> = Delta Distance<sub>time</sub> - Delta Distance<sub>time - 10</sub>

Because we're only interested in how fast they are going relative to other points in the transect, I will leave distance units as degrees and will calculate speed as degrees per second.

``` r
transects <- transects %>% 
             group_by(transect) %>%
             mutate(distance = sqrt((lat - lag(lat))^2 + (long - lag(long))^2)) 

transects$distance[is.na(transects$distance)] <- 0

transects <- transects %>%
             group_by(transect) %>%
             mutate(distance = cumsum(distance - min(distance)))

transects <- transects %>%
             group_by(transect) %>%
             mutate(speed = (distance - lag(distance, n = 10, default = 0))/10)

ggplot(transects) +
  geom_line(aes(x = distance, y = speed)) +
  facet_wrap(~ transect, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Distance along the transect (degrees)", y = "Speed (degrees/second)") +
  theme_bw()
```

This looks interesting. This visualization shows too much variation. Smoothing (running average) the plots might make points where the divers stop easier. Another alternative is simply to plot the transects, with color based on speed. Because average speed was different amongst transects, let's increase contrast of the colors. To do so, I will standardize the speed within each individual transect (subtract mean and divide by sd). We lose information about speed differences amongst transects but keep information about the parts of a transect that were slow, compared to the rest of the same transect.

``` r
transects <- transects %>%
             group_by(transect) %>%
             mutate(scaled_speed = (speed - mean(speed))/sd(speed),
                    extremety = case_when(nr == min(nr) ~ "start",
                                          nr == max(nr) ~ "end",
                                          TRUE ~ "no"))

ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = transects,
            aes(x = long, y = lat, color = scaled_speed), 
            size = 2) +
  scale_color_gradient(high = "#ff0008", low = "#0061ff") +
  geom_point(data = transects %>% filter(extremety %in% c("start","end")),
             aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = extremety),
             size = 3,
             shape = 21) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("start" = "#33a02c", "end" = "#ff7f00")) + 
  facet_wrap(~ transect, scales = "free")+
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", color = "Scaled speed", fill = "") +
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="README_files/figure-markdown_github/scaled_speed-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is promising. Parts of slower movement are visible along the transect. Let's add even more contrast by dividing points based on quantiles. Sections with speed below the decided quantile will be colored blue. A bit of trial and error showed that 40th quantile is a good compromise for all transects.

``` r
transects <- transects %>%
             group_by(transect) %>%
             mutate(quant40_speed= ifelse(scaled_speed < quantile(scaled_speed, 0.40), "slow", "fast"))

ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = transects, aes(x = long, y = lat, color = quant40_speed, group = transect), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#ff0008","#0061ff")) +
  facet_wrap(~ transect, scales = "free")+
  geom_point(data = transects %>% filter(extremety %in% c("start","end")),
             aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = extremety),
             size = 3,
             shape = 21) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("start" = "#33a02c", "end" = "#ff7f00")) + 
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", color = "Speed", fill = "") +
  theme_bw()
```

We're getting somewhere now.

Plot points obtained by checking the camera
-------------------------------------------

All of the sampling points were manually determined using video footage of the dive and cross referencing the times at which samples were taken with with time of the GPS footage. To see how effective our sampling point location is we can now plot automatic and manually determined points and see how close they are.

``` r
#Function that identifies when the divers are stopped and gives those points an ID number
identify_points <- function(vector,interval){
  interval <- interval - 1
  point_id <- 1                       #initialize a number to identify sampling points
  ids <- vector(mode = "numeric")     #Vector to store point ids
  for(i in 1:length(vector)){
    #If 10 points in a row are considered slow, return TRUE (divers are stoped)
    stopped <- all(c(vector[i:i+interval]) == "slow")
    
    ids <- ids %>%          #If diver is stoped, give point an ID, else NA
           c(ifelse(stopped,
           point_id,
           NA))
    
    point_id <- ifelse(stopped, point_id, point_id + 1) #If divers are moving again, increase point ID counter. This does not identify the points in numeric order, but that is not necessary
  }
  return(ids)
}

transects_smooth <- transects %>%         #To plot smooth transects I will average every 10 points and plot a path
                    select(lat, long, nr, transect, extremety) %>%
                    group_by(transect) %>%
                    mutate(long = rollmean(long, 10, fill = NA),
                           lat  = rollmean(lat, 10, fill = NA)) %>%
                    filter(!is.na(lat)) %>%
                    .[seq(1, nrow(.), 10),]  %>% #Select every 10th point
                    ungroup()

sampling_points <- read_csv2("./sampling_points.csv") %>%  #Import the manually determined points
                   rename(transect = Transect, long = Long, lat = Lat) %>%
                   mutate(name = "sampling point")

estimated_points <- transects %>%
                    mutate(sample_points = identify_points(quant40_speed, 15)) %>%
                    filter(!is.na(sample_points)) %>%
                    group_by(transect, sample_points) %>%
                    summarise(lat = mean(lat), long = mean(long)) %>%
                    mutate(name = "estimated point") %>%
                    ungroup()

plot_points <- transects %>% ungroup %>%
               filter(extremety %in% c("start","end")) %>%
               select(transect, long, lat, name = extremety) 

plot_points <- plot_points %>%
               rbind(sampling_points %>% select(transect, long, lat, name))

plot_points <- plot_points %>%
               rbind(estimated_points %>% select(transect, long, lat, name))

ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = transects_smooth, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = transect), size = 1) +
  geom_point(data = plot_points, aes( x = long, y = lat, color = name, size = name)) +
  facet_wrap(~ transect, scales = "free") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("start" = "#33a02c", "end" = "#ff7f00", "sampling point" = "red", "estimated point" = "blue")) + 
  scale_size_manual(values = c("start" = 3, "end" = 3, "sampling point" = 2, "estimated point" = 1), guide = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", color = "Speed", fill = "") +
  theme_bw()

This methodology seems to be usefull to approximate sampling locations without manually going through video footage. One pattern is also very obvious: it was much more accurate in the last 2 transects than the first ones. There are also some points that were not detected at all. Here is the list of reasons I believe is causing the largest flaws in the method:
\* One of the divers was using a scuba scooter for the first time. I believe this is why there are some random stops in transect 1
\* In areas where there was no caulerpa, the divers simply kept going, meaning there is no stop
\* Part of transect one was not even recorded in the GPS data (memory was full and it was overwritten)

Much of this can be fixed:
\* Change GPS to record points every 5 seconds, rather than 1 increases the time we can record 5-fold (and carry an extra GPS just in case)
\* Ensure divers ALWAYS stop a minimum of 30 seconds, even if there is no Caulerpa in the area
\* Record transect start and end time, so that transects can be extracted easily \* Extract number of estimated sampling points and see if they match real number of samples as a checking method
